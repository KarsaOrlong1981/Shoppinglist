# Shoppinglist
Xamarin App as hobby Activity and as an exercise in creating dynamic controls
With this app, multiple shopping lists, for example, can be created and saved for the whole week. In addition, shops can be recreated from the entrance to the checkout and variable can be selected. Everything is stored via SQLite and retrieved when needed. Mainly I wanted to create dynamic controls here to get some practice in using them.
